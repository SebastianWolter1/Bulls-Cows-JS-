This is Bulls&Cows, a simple console game.

The user has to guess 4 unique numbers, which randomly are set by the computer.

For every correct number at the correct position, you will get a bull.
For every correct number at a wrong position, you will get a cow.

Attempts will be counted, so try to be smart enough to solve the game with <10 attempts:)

(You can also try to type words or incorrect numbers....)




Tasks to improve the game:

- Level selector: decide how many numbers you will have to guess (4-10)


- Random message generator: 
    - if attempts <=5 return: you are very smart (or very lucky)
    - if attempts <=10 return: well done
    - if attempts <=20 return: good one, try to solve it with less than 10 attempts
    - if attempts >=21 return: maybe the game is to hard for you:)
